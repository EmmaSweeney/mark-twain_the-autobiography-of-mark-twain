				<h3>
					<i>Written in 1900</i>
				</h3>
				<p>It happened in London; not recently, and yet not very many years ago. An acquaintance had proposed to himself a certain labor of love, and when he told me about it I was interested. His idea was to have a fine translation made of the evidence given in the <i>Joan of Arc Trials and Rehabilitation,</i> and placed before the English-speaking world. A translation had been made and published a great many years before, but had achieved no currency, and in fact was not entitled to any, for it was a piece of mere shoemaker-work. But we should have the proper thing, now; for this acquaintance of mine was manifestly a Joan enthusiast, and as he had plenty of money and nothing to do but spend it, I took at par his remark that he had employed the most competent person in Great Britain to open this long-neglected mine and confer its riches upon the public. When he asked me to write an Introduction for the book, my pleasure was complete, my vanity satisfied.</p>
				<p>At this moment, by good fortune, there chanced to fall into my hands a biographical sketch of me of so just and laudatory a character--particularly as concerned one detail--that it gave my spirit great contentment; and also set my head to swelling--I will not deny it. For it contained praises of the very thing which I most loved to hear praised--<i>the good quality of my English</i><i>;</i> moreover, they were uttered by four English and American literary experts of high authority.</p>
				<p>I am as fond of compliments as another, and as hard to satisfy as the average; but these satisfied me. I was as pleased as you would have been if they had been paid to you.</p>
				<p>It was under the inspiration of that great several-voiced verdict that I set about that Introduction for Mr. X's book; and I said to myself that I would put a quality of English into it which would establish the righteousness of that judgment. I said I would treat the subject with the reverence and dignity due it; and would use plain, simple English words, and a phrasing undefiled by meretricious artificialities and affectations.</p>
				<p>I did the work on those lines; and when it was finished I said to myself very privately . . .</p>
				<p>But never mind. I delivered the MS. to Mr. X, and went home to wait for the praises. On the way I met a friend. Being in a happy glow over this pleasant matter, I could not keep my secret. I wanted to tell somebody, and I told him. For a moment he stood curiously measuring me up and down with his eye, without saying anything; then he burst into a rude, coarse laugh, which hurt me very much. He followed this up by saying:</p>
				<p><i>"He</i> is going to edit the translations of the <i>Trials</i> when it is finished? <i>He?"</i></p>
				<p>"He said he would."</p>
				<p>"Why, what does he know about editing?"</p>
				<p>"I don't know; but that is what he said. Do you think he isn't competent?"</p>
				<p>"Competent? He is innocent, vain, ignorant, good-hearted, red-headed, and all that--there isn't a better-meaning man; but he doesn't know anything about literature and has had no literary training or experience; <i>he</i> can't edit anything."</p>
				<p>"Well, all I know is, he is going to try."</p>
				<p>"Indeed he will! He is quite unconscious of his incapacities; he would undertake to edit Shakespeare, if invited--and improve him, too. The world cannot furnish his match for guileless self-complacency; yet I give you my word he doesn't know enough to come in when it rains."</p>
				<p>This gentleman's ability to judge was not to be questioned. Therefore, by the time I reached home I had concluded to ask Mr. X not to edit the translation, but to turn that work over to some expert whose name on the title page would be valuable.</p>
				<p>Three days later Mr. X brought my Introduction to me, neatly typecopied. He was in a state of considerable enthusiasm, and said:</p>
				<p>"Really I find it quite good--quite, I assure you."</p>
				<p>There was an airy and patronizing complacency about this damp compliment which affected my head and healthfully checked the swelling which was going on there.</p>
				<p>I said, with cold dignity, that I was glad the work had earned his approval.</p>
				<p>"Oh, it has, I assure you!" he answered, with large cheerfulness. "I assure you it quite has. I have gone over it very thoroughly, yesterday and last night and to-day, and I find it quite creditable--quite. I have made a few corrections--that is, suggestions, and--"</p>
				<p>"Do you mean to say that you have been ed--"</p>
				<p>"Oh, nothing of consequence, nothing of consequence, I assure you," he said, patting me on the shoulder and genially smiling; "only a few little things that needed just a mere polishing touch--nothing of consequence, I assure you. Let me have it back as soon as you can, so that I can pass it on to the printers and let them get to work on it while I am editing the translation."</p>
				<p>I sat idle and alone, a time, thinking grieved thoughts, with the edited Introduction unopened in my hand. I could not look at it yet awhile. I had no heart for it, for my pride was deeply wounded. It was the only time I had been edited in thirty-two years, except by Mr. Howells, and he did not intrude his help, but furnished it at my request. "And now here is a half-stranger, obscure, destitute of literary training, destitute of literary experience, destitute of--"</p>
				<p>But I checked myself there; for that way lay madness. I must seek calm; for my self-respect's sake I must not descend to unrefined personalities. I must keep in mind that this person was innocent of injurious intent and was honorably trying to do me a service. To feel harshly toward him, speak harshly of him--this was not the right Christian spirit. These just thoughts tranquillized me and restored to me my better self, and I opened the Introduction at the middle.</p>
				<p>I will not deny it, my feelings rose to 104 in the shade:</p>
				<p>"The idea! That this long-eared animal--this literary kangaroo--this illiterate hostler, with his skull full of axle grease--this . . ."</p>
				<p>But I stopped there, for this was not the right Christian spirit.</p>
				<p>I subjected myself to an hour of calming meditation, then carried the raped Introduction to that friend whom I have mentioned above and showed it to him. He fluttered the leaves over, then broke into another of those ill-bred laughs which are such a mar to him.</p>
				<p>"I knew he would!" he said--as if gratified. "Didn't I tell you he would edit Shakespeare?"</p>
				<p>"Yes, I know; but I did not suppose he would edit <i>me</i><i>."</i></p>
				<p>"Oh, you didn't! Well, now you see that he is even equal to <i>that</i><i>.</i> I tell you there are simply no bounds to that man's irreverence."</p>
				<p>"I realize it, now," I said.</p>
				<p>"Well, what are you going to do? Let him put it in his book--either edited or unedited?"</p>
				<p>"Of course not!"</p>
				<p>"That is well. You are becoming rational again. But what are your plans? You are not going to stop where you are, are you? You will write him a letter and give him Hark from the Tomb?"</p>
				<p>"No, I shall write him a letter, but not in that spirit, I trust."</p>
				<p><i>"Why</i> shan't you?"</p>
				<p>"Because he has meant me a kindness, and I hope I am not the man to reward him for it in that way."</p>
				<p>The friend looked me over awhile, pensively, then said--</p>
				<p>"Mark, I am ashamed of you. This is mere schoolgirl sentimentality. You ought to baste him--you know it yourself."</p>
				<p>I said I had no such feeling in my heart and should put nothing of the kind in my letter.</p>
				<p>"I shall point out his errors to him in gentleness and in the unwounding language of persuasion. Many a literary beginner has been disheartened and defeated by the uncharitable word wantonly uttered; this one shall get none such from me. It is more Christian-like to do a good turn than an ill one, and you ought to encourage me in my attitude, not scoff at it. This man shall not be my enemy; I will make him my lasting and grateful friend."</p>
				<p>I felt that I was in the right, and I went home and began the letter and found pleasure and contentment in the labor, for I had the encouragement and support of an approving conscience.</p>
				<p>The letter will be found in its proper place in this chapter of my <i>Autobiography;</i> it follows:</p>
