					<p>Most of Mark Twain’s work up to this time, <i>Roughing It, Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi,</i> <abbr>etc.</abbr>, had been of an autobiographical nature. Also, as early as 1870 he had jotted down an occasional reminiscent chapter, for possible publication, though apparently with no idea of a continuous narrative. Such of these chapters as have survived are included in Vol. I of the present work. <cite>—A. B. P.</cite> <a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>In a statement made somewhat later, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clemens said that he had first heard Gilder mention this fact as they were leaving Chickering Hall. <a href="the-grant-dictations.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This is the remark I have already several times referred to. I’ve got Smith’s exact language (from my notebook); it proves that they thought 10-per-cent royalty would actually represent half profits on General Grant’s book!</p>

				<li id="note-11" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The machine in the end proved a complete failure, being too complicated, too difficult to keep in order. It cost Mark Twain a total of about $190,000. <cite>—A. B. P.</cite> <a href="the-machine-episode.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
