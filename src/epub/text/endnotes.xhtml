					<p>Most of Mark Twain’s work up to this time, <i>Roughing It, Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi,</i> <abbr>etc.</abbr>, had been of an autobiographical nature. Also, as early as 1870 he had jotted down an occasional reminiscent chapter, for possible publication, though apparently with no idea of a continuous narrative. Such of these chapters as have survived are included in Vol. I of the present work.⁠—A. B. P. <a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>These prices of 1877 are as interesting to-day as those of forty years earlier. <a href="early-years-in-florida-missouri.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>August, 1885. They deny this now, but I go bail I got that statement from Gilder himself.⁠—S. L. C. <a href="about-general-grants-memoirs.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>In a statement made somewhat later, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clemens said that he had first heard Gilder mention this fact as they were leaving Chickering Hall. <a href="about-general-grants-memoirs.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This had occurred during their first interview. <a href="about-general-grants-memoirs.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This is the remark I have already several times referred to. I’ve got Smith’s exact language (from my notebook); it proves that they thought 10-per-cent royalty would actually represent half profits on General Grant’s book!</p>
					<p>Note added <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 10, 1885, 250,000 sets⁠—500,000 single copies⁠—have been sold to date⁠—and only half the ground canvassed. <a href="about-general-grants-memoirs.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The Grant dictations ended here. General Grant died July 25, 1885. More than 300,000 sets, of two vols. each, of his <i>Memoirs</i> were sold. <a href="gerhardt-and-the-grant-bust.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				</li>
				<li id="note-11" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The machine in the end proved a complete failure, being too complicated, too difficult to keep in order. It cost Mark Twain a total of about $190,000.⁠—A. B. P. <a href="the-machine-episode.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clemens evidently intended to precede this paragraph with some data concerning his New England ancestry, but he never did so.⁠—A. B. P. <a href="chapters-begun-in-vienna.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
